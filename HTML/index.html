    Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. Known for his aggressive batting style and exceptional consistency, Kohli has made significant contributions to Indian cricket across all formats.

Kohli began his international career in 2008 and quickly rose to prominence. He has captained the Indian national team in all three formats—Tests, ODIs, and T20Is—leading the team to numerous victories. Under his leadership, India won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup12.

In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli represents Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and holds the record for the highest run-scorer in the tournament’s history1. His dedication to fitness and his aggressive approach have set new standards in the sport, earning him accolades from cricket legends and fans alike.

Off the field, Kohli is known for his philanthropic efforts and his commitment to various social causes. He is married to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, and together they are one of India’s most celebrated couples1.
